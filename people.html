					<p>We are the 4 primary authors of this work:</p>

					<h2>Jarrod Knibbe</h2>
					<p>I'm a lecturer at the <a href=https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/860467-jarrod-knibbe>University of Melbourne</a>. I have a special interest in Electric Muscle Stimulation (EMS). Much of my prior work has explored how to make multi-electrode setups 'work', especially by trying to solve the associated calibration problems. See, for example, the below papers:</p>

					<p>Graeme Gange and Jarrod Knibbe, <a href=https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AAAI-8542.GangeG.pdf>Optimising Automatic Calibration of Electric Muscle Stimulation</a>, AAAI 2021 (final version to appear soon)</p>

					<p>Jarrod Knibbe, Paul Strohmeier, Sebastian Boring, and Kasper Hornbaek, <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3130933>Automatic Calibration of High-density Electric Muscle Stimulation</a>, in IMWUT 2017.</p>

					<p>Henning Pohl, Kasper Hornbaek, and Jarrod Knibbe, <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3174910.3174948>Wanding Through Space: Interactive Calibration for Electric Muscle Stimulation</a>, in AH 2018.</p>

					<h2>Rachel Freire</h2>
					<p>I run my own studio, Freire Studios, in London, UK. While much of my interest has been in fashion and costume design, I have always been especially interested in electronic textiles and how to incorporate electronics into my art. I have collaborated with Paul, and increasingly Jarrod, extensively. For example, at TEI a couple of years ago, we ran a <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173225.3173331>3D tailoring workshop</a>.</p>

					<h2>Marion Koelle</h2>
					<p>I'm a post doc in Saarbrucken. My interest is in the social acceptability of wearables. Check out some of my other work on <a href=https://www.marionkoelle.de>my website</a></p>

					<h2>Paul Strohmeier</h2>
					<p>I build wearables and haptics and stuff. Everyone should read my PhD thesis: <a href=http://www.embodimentlabs.org/papers/2019_PhDThesis_Strohmeier.pdf>Shaping Material Experiences: Designing Vibrotactile Feedback for Active Perception</a>. (Jarrod wrote this - seriously, though, worth a read.)</p>

					<p>Realistically, however, this work has been many years in the making and has also involved numerous other collaborators. Special thanks to: Kasper Hornbaek, Elliott Wilson, Sam Trolland, Jaehyun Shin, Melanie Huang, and Gerard Mason.</p>
